I'm a guy, I've had my own body insecurity issues, whatever. But to see Gemma's situation unfold at the age that I did was just absolutely heartbreaking. She was going through so much, and to get shamed about her body in the midst of it felt so heartbreaking to watch. Women never get the luxury of being mediocre. The luxury of being average. We keep talking about how ""oh, it's so awesome, women who are curvy are having their moment"" but never the conversation of women being more than their bodies. Women are beyond their bodies. Gemma was more than her physique. She was a human being, and it's so heartbreaking to know that she was at her most vulnerable when the story about her broke out.",Rene Diaz,,,493

My nickname among my friends was praying mantis I was so skinny. So after my agent snubbed his nose up at my body and told me that other models sometimes go without meals and i heard other models who were purging and injecting between their toes I walked away for good at aged 19.

I actually agree with the argument you made about Beyonce sexualizing her body. Why? Because she, like many other women celebrities, are victims of this system that wants women to expose their bodies, selling it for ""freedom"". Would she have gained the same success without her body being so sexualized? Yes, I'm sure she would, she has the talent. So what was the need for doing that? I think the point you made back then is still valid. I am Italian, therefore European, and I have relatives in the US, and I notice the difference between our beauty standards, between how I and my American cousins (same age) pose for Instagram selfies, or what outfits they and I wear. I'm sorry to say they think ""horny"" is sexy. And this overly sexualized body image issue has nothing to do with freedom. Women should be free to show off their body, if that's what they want, no argue about that. But sexualizing body, as the only to be ""sexy""...to whom? To man. No, that's not freedom. It's a big fat lie. It's a trap. Choosing to expose our bodies to please ourselves is freedom, doing it to please audience (male mostly) is not. There is a difference.",Sghisha,,,51

Every audition, every master class where there has been an older female (usually a retired dancer), my daughter is invisible. Now auditions with men, no matter the age or whether they were a dancer, they love her! Idk what it is, I have some ideas but it's the most bizarre thing ever. Every SI audition season, if there is an female (specifically over about 50) my daughter says, ""well, I'm not getting in.""

I say this with love. You interrupt and talk over your interviewees too much. Easily sorted! I know it's enthusiasm (I do the same thing!) but you just need to relax back a little more and allow that person to fill up the space. Otherwise it feels like the interviewee is there to support what you've gone in to capture. It's just a little adjustment and skill - but if you love to do this, I reckon you could be world class due to your way of relating to people. You have so much to say that is essential, and a lot of wisdom to share. Thank you for these - as a NB person with horrible body dysmorphia I really appreciate it.
